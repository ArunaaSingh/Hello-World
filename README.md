Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This README file is dedicated to describe and clarify the procedure and steps followed for John Hopkns Getting and Cleaning Data Course project. There are three files in this repo. 1- run_analysis.R : Conatains the code that does the analysis and outputs a tidy data set. 2- Codebook: Modifies and defines variables and infrmation related to the dataset. 3- README file: This file ! an overview for the work done and a simple guide for this repo. I have followed these steps to do the analysis: 1- Of course, downloading the datasets and reading them into R. 2- Merging the required datasets together. 3- Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 4- providing the dataset with descriptive variable names. 5- Calculating the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
